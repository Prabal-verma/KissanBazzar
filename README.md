## Project Overview

KissanBazaar aims to address the common challenges in contract farming, such as unreliable market access, lack of transparency, and time-consuming negotiations. It provides a digital solution where farmers and buyers can create legally binding contracts, ensuring secure transactions and stable incomes.

### Problem Solved by KissanBazaar

1. **Uncertain Market Access:** KissanBazaar connects farmers with verified buyers, reducing the risk of unpredictable sales and income.
2. **Lack of Trust and Transparency:** The platform ensures all contract terms are clearly defined, reducing disputes.
3. **Time-Consuming Negotiations:** Guided workflows streamline the creation and negotiation of contracts, saving time for both parties.
4. **Limited Market Information:** Farmers can access market data, helping them make informed decisions about their crops and sales.

## Tasks Completed

1. **Contract Management:** Developed features to create, manage, and track contracts between farmers and buyers.
2. **User Authentication:** Implemented authentication for different user roles, including farmers and buyers.
3. **Database Integration:** Used MongoDB for data storage, managing user information, contract details, and transactions.
4. **Responsive UI:** Built a responsive interface using Next.js and Tailwind CSS for an optimal user experience on all devices.
5. **API Development:** Created APIs for handling contract operations, authentication, and data retrieval.
6. **Testing and Deployment:** Conducted thorough testing and deployed the platform using Vercel for seamless access.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose
- **Authentication:** Custom authentication solution with JWT
- **Deployment:** Vercel
- **Design:** Figma for UI/UX design

## Key Features

- **Contract Creation and Management:** Easy-to-use interface for creating and managing farming contracts.
- **User Authentication:** Secure login for farmers and buyers with role-based access control.
- **Dashboard:** Provides a centralized view of ongoing contracts, pending actions, and important notifications.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Built with scalability in mind, allowing for future expansion and integration with other services.
